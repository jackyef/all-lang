# `all-lang`

This repo contains all the programming languages known to GitHub.

## Why?
I was curious to see how the language charts is going to look like if a repository has a lot of languages.

## Is this up-to-date?
For the most part, it should be. I am looking into setting up GitHub action to update it automatically, but it isn't implemented yet.
